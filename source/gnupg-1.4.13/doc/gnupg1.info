1 Invoking GPG
**************

`gpg' is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a
tool to provide digital encryption and signing services using the
OpenPGP standard. `gpg' features complete key management and all bells
and whistles you can expect from a decent OpenPGP implementation.

   This is the standalone version of `gpg'.  For desktop use you should
consider using `gpg2' (1).

1.1 Commands
============

Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that
only one command is allowed.

   `gpg' may be run with no commands, in which case it will perform a
reasonable action depending on the type of file it is given as input
(an encrypted message is decrypted, a signature is verified, a file
containing keys is listed).

   Please remember that option as well as command parsing stops as soon
as a non-option is encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing by
using the special option `--'.

* Menu:

* General GPG Commands::        Commands not specific to the functionality.
* Operational GPG Commands::    Commands to select the type of operation.
* OpenPGP Key Management::      How to manage your keys.

1.1.2 Commands to select the type of operation
----------------------------------------------

`--sign'
`-s'
     Make a signature. This command may be combined with `--encrypt'
     (for a signed and encrypted message), `--symmetric' (for a signed
     and symmetrically encrypted message), or `--encrypt' and
     `--symmetric' together (for a signed message that may be decrypted
     via a secret key or a passphrase).  The key to be used for signing
     is chosen by default or can be set with the `--local-user' and
     `--default-key' options.

`--clearsign'
     Make a clear text signature.  The content in a clear text
     signature is readable without any special software. OpenPGP
     software is only needed to verify the signature.  Clear text
     signatures may modify end-of-line whitespace for platform
     independence and are not intended to be reversible.  The key to be
     used for signing is chosen by default or can be set with the
     `--local-user' and `--default-key' options.

`--detach-sign'
`-b'
     Make a detached signature.

`--encrypt'
`-e'
     Encrypt data. This option may be combined with `--sign' (for a
     signed and encrypted message), `--symmetric' (for a message that
     may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or `--sign'
     and `--symmetric' together (for a signed message that may be
     decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).

`--symmetric'
`-c'
     Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The default
     symmetric cipher used is CAST5, but may be chosen with the
     `--cipher-algo' option. This option may be combined with `--sign'
     (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), `--encrypt'
     (for a message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a
     passphrase), or `--sign' and `--encrypt' together (for a signed
     message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).

`--store'
     Store only (make a simple RFC1991 literal data packet).

`--decrypt'
`-d'
     Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN if no file is
     specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file specified with
     `--output'). If the decrypted file is signed, the signature is also
     verified. This command differs from the default operation, as it
     never writes to the filename which is included in the file and it
     rejects files which don't begin with an encrypted message.

`--verify'
     Assume that the first argument is a signed file or a detached
     signature and verify it without generating any output. With no
     arguments, the signature packet is read from STDIN. If only a
     sigfile is given, it may be a complete signature or a detached
     signature, in which case the signed stuff is expected in a file
     without the ".sig" or ".asc" extension.  With more than 1
     argument, the first should be a detached signature and the
     remaining files are the signed stuff. To read the signed stuff
     from STDIN, use `-' as the second filename.  For security reasons
     a detached signature cannot read the signed material from STDIN
     without denoting it in the above way.

`--multifile'
     This modifies certain other commands to accept multiple files for
     processing on the command line or read from STDIN with each
     filename on a separate line. This allows for many files to be
     processed at once. `--multifile' may currently be used along with
     `--verify', `--encrypt', and `--decrypt'. Note that `--multifile
     --verify' may not be used with detached signatures.

`--verify-files'
     Identical to `--multifile --verify'.

`--encrypt-files'
     Identical to `--multifile --encrypt'.

`--decrypt-files'
     Identical to `--multifile --decrypt'.

`--list-keys'
`-k'
`--list-public-keys'
     List all keys from the public keyrings, or just the keys given on
     the command line.  `-k' is slightly different from `--list-keys'
     in that it allows only for one argument and takes the second
     argument as the keyring to search.  This is for command line
     compatibility with PGP 2 and has been removed in `gpg2'.

     Avoid using the output of this command in scripts or other
     programs as it is likely to change as GnuPG changes. See
     `--with-colons' for a machine-parseable key listing command that
     is appropriate for use in scripts and other programs.

`--list-secret-keys'
`-K'
     List all keys from the secret keyrings, or just the ones given on
     the command line. A `#' after the letters `sec' means that the
     secret key is not usable (for example, if it was created via
     `--export-secret-subkeys').

`--list-sigs'
     Same as `--list-keys', but the signatures are listed too.

     For each signature listed, there are several flags in between the
     "sig" tag and keyid. These flags give additional information about
     each signature. From left to right, they are the numbers 1-3 for
     certificate check level (see `--ask-cert-level'), "L" for a local
     or non-exportable signature (see `--lsign-key'), "R" for a
     nonRevocable signature (see the `--edit-key' command "nrsign"),
     "P" for a signature that contains a policy URL (see
     `--cert-policy-url'), "N" for a signature that contains a notation
     (see `--cert-notation'), "X" for an eXpired signature (see
     `--ask-cert-expire'), and the numbers 1-9 or "T" for 10 and above
     to indicate trust signature levels (see the `--edit-key' command
     "tsign").

`--check-sigs'
     Same as `--list-sigs', but the signatures are verified.  Note that
     for performance reasons the revocation status of a signing key is
     not shown.

     The status of the verification is indicated by a flag directly
     following the "sig" tag (and thus before the flags described above
     for `--list-sigs').  A "!" indicates that the signature has been
     successfully verified, a "-" denotes a bad signature and a "%" is
     used if an error occurred while checking the signature (e.g. a non
     supported algorithm).

`--fingerprint'
     List all keys (or the specified ones) along with their
     fingerprints. This is the same output as `--list-keys' but with
     the additional output of a line with the fingerprint. May also be
     combined with `--list-sigs' or `--check-sigs'.  If this command is
     given twice, the fingerprints of all secondary keys are listed too.

`--list-packets'
     List only the sequence of packets. This is mainly useful for
     debugging.

`--card-edit'
     Present a menu to work with a smartcard. The subcommand "help"
     provides an overview on available commands. For a detailed
     description, please see the Card HOWTO at
     http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO .

`--card-status'
     Show the content of the smart card.

`--change-pin'
     Present a menu to allow changing the PIN of a smartcard. This
     functionality is also available as the subcommand "passwd" with the
     `--card-edit' command.

`--delete-key `name''
     Remove key from the public keyring. In batch mode either `--yes' is
     required or the key must be specified by fingerprint. This is a
     safeguard against accidental deletion of multiple keys.

`--delete-secret-key `name''
     Remove key from the secret and public keyring. In batch mode the
     key must be specified by fingerprint.

`--delete-secret-and-public-key `name''
     Same as `--delete-key', but if a secret key exists, it will be
     removed first. In batch mode the key must be specified by
     fingerprint.

`--export'
     Either export all keys from all keyrings (default keyrings and
     those registered via option `--keyring'), or if at least one name
     is given, those of the given name. The new keyring is written to
     STDOUT or to the file given with option `--output'. Use together
     with `--armor' to mail those keys.

`--send-keys `key IDs''
     Similar to `--export' but sends the keys to a keyserver.
     Fingerprints may be used instead of key IDs. Option `--keyserver'
     must be used to give the name of this keyserver. Don't send your
     complete keyring to a keyserver -- select only those keys which
     are new or changed by you.  If no key IDs are given, `gpg' does
     nothing.

`--export-secret-keys'
`--export-secret-subkeys'
     Same as `--export', but exports the secret keys instead.  This is
     normally not very useful and a security risk.  The second form of
     the command has the special property to render the secret part of
     the primary key useless; this is a GNU extension to OpenPGP and
     other implementations can not be expected to successfully import
     such a key.  See the option `--simple-sk-checksum' if you want to
     import such an exported key with an older OpenPGP implementation.

`--import'
`--fast-import'
     Import/merge keys. This adds the given keys to the keyring. The
     fast version is currently just a synonym.

     There are a few other options which control how this command works.
     Most notable here is the `--import-options merge-only' option
     which does not insert new keys but does only the merging of new
     signatures, user-IDs and subkeys.

`--recv-keys `key IDs''
     Import the keys with the given key IDs from a keyserver. Option
     `--keyserver' must be used to give the name of this keyserver.

`--refresh-keys'
     Request updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist on the
     local keyring. This is useful for updating a key with the latest
     signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling this with no arguments will
     refresh the entire keyring. Option `--keyserver' must be used to
     give the name of the keyserver for all keys that do not have
     preferred keyservers set (see `--keyserver-options
     honor-keyserver-url').

`--search-keys `names''
     Search the keyserver for the given names. Multiple names given
     here will be joined together to create the search string for the
     keyserver.  Option `--keyserver' must be used to give the name of
     this keyserver.  Keyservers that support different search methods
     allow using the syntax specified in "How to specify a user ID"
     below. Note that different keyserver types support different
     search methods. Currently only LDAP supports them all.

`--fetch-keys `URIs''
     Retrieve keys located at the specified URIs. Note that different
     installations of GnuPG may support different protocols (HTTP, FTP,
     LDAP, etc.)

`--update-trustdb'
     Do trust database maintenance. This command iterates over all keys
     and builds the Web of Trust. This is an interactive command
     because it may have to ask for the "ownertrust" values for keys.
     The user has to give an estimation of how far she trusts the owner
     of the displayed key to correctly certify (sign) other keys. GnuPG
     only asks for the ownertrust value if it has not yet been assigned
     to a key. Using the `--edit-key' menu, the assigned value can be
     changed at any time.

`--check-trustdb'
     Do trust database maintenance without user interaction. From time
     to time the trust database must be updated so that expired keys or
     signatures and the resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be
     tracked. Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is required and
     do it automatically unless `--no-auto-check-trustdb' is set. This
     command can be used to force a trust database check at any time.
     The processing is identical to that of `--update-trustdb' but it
     skips keys with a not yet defined "ownertrust".

     For use with cron jobs, this command can be used together with
     `--batch' in which case the trust database check is done only if a
     check is needed. To force a run even in batch mode add the option
     `--yes'.

`--export-ownertrust'
     Send the ownertrust values to STDOUT. This is useful for backup
     purposes as these values are the only ones which can't be
     re-created from a corrupted trustdb.  Example:
            gpg --export-ownertrust > otrust.txt

`--import-ownertrust'
     Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values stored in `files' (or
     STDIN if not given); existing values will be overwritten.  In case
     of a severely damaged trustdb and if you have a recent backup of
     the ownertrust values (e.g. in the file `otrust.txt', you may
     re-create the trustdb using these commands:
            cd ~/.gnupg
            rm trustdb.gpg
            gpg --import-ownertrust < otrust.txt

`--rebuild-keydb-caches'
     When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should be
     used to create signature caches in the keyring. It might be handy
     in other situations too.

`--print-md `algo''
`--print-mds'
     Print message digest of algorithm ALGO for all given files or
     STDIN.  With the second form (or a deprecated "*" as algo) digests
     for all available algorithms are printed.

`--gen-random `0|1|2' `count''
     Emit COUNT random bytes of the given quality level 0, 1 or 2. If
     COUNT is not given or zero, an endless sequence of random bytes
     will be emitted.  If used with `--armor' the output will be base64
     encoded.  PLEASE, don't use this command unless you know what you
     are doing; it may remove precious entropy from the system!

`--gen-prime `mode'  `bits''
     Use the source, Luke :-). The output format is still subject to
     change.

`--enarmor'

`--dearmor'
     Pack or unpack an arbitrary input into/from an OpenPGP ASCII armor.
     This is a GnuPG extension to OpenPGP and in general not very
     useful.

1.1.3 How to manage your keys
-----------------------------

This section explains the main commands for key management

`--gen-key'
     Generate a new key pair. This command is normally only used
     interactively.

     There is an experimental feature which allows you to create keys in
     batch mode. See the file `doc/DETAILS' in the source distribution
     on how to use this.

`--gen-revoke `name''
     Generate a revocation certificate for the complete key. To revoke
     a subkey or a signature, use the `--edit' command.

`--desig-revoke `name''
     Generate a designated revocation certificate for a key. This
     allows a user (with the permission of the keyholder) to revoke
     someone else's key.

`--edit-key'
     Present a menu which enables you to do most of the key management
     related tasks.  It expects the specification of a key on the
     command line.

    uid `n'
          Toggle selection of user ID or photographic user ID with
          index `n'.    Use `*' to select all and `0' to deselect all.

    key `n'
          Toggle selection of subkey with index `n'.    Use `*' to
          select all and `0' to deselect all.

    sign
          Make a signature on key of user `name' If the key is not yet
          signed by the default user (or the users given with -u), the
          program   displays the information of the key again, together
          with its   fingerprint and asks whether it should be signed.
          This question is   repeated for all users specified with   -u.

    lsign
          Same as "sign" but the signature is marked as non-exportable
          and will   therefore never be used by others. This may be
          used to make keys   valid only in the local environment.

    nrsign
          Same as "sign" but the signature is marked as non-revocable
          and can   therefore never be revoked.

    tsign
          Make a trust signature. This is a signature that combines the
          notions   of certification (like a regular signature), and
          trust (like the   "trust" command). It is generally only
          useful in distinct communities   or groups.

     Note that "l" (for local / non-exportable), "nr" (for
     non-revocable, and "t" (for trust) may be freely mixed and
     prefixed to "sign" to create a signature of any type desired.

    delsig
          Delete a signature. Note that it is not possible to retract a
          signature,   once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a
          keyserver).  In that case   you better use `revsig'.

    revsig
          Revoke a signature. For every signature which has been
          generated by   one of the secret keys, GnuPG asks whether a
          revocation certificate   should be generated.

    check
          Check the signatures on all selected user IDs.

    adduid
          Create an additional user ID.

    addphoto
          Create a photographic user ID. This will prompt for a JPEG
          file that   will be embedded into the user ID. Note that a
          very large JPEG will make   for a very large key. Also note
          that some programs will display your   JPEG unchanged
          (GnuPG), and some programs will scale it to fit in a   dialog
          box (PGP).

    showphoto
          Display the selected photographic user ID.

    deluid
          Delete a user ID or photographic user ID.  Note that it is not
           possible to retract a user id, once it has been send to the
          public   (i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case you better use
          `revuid'.

    revuid
          Revoke a user ID or photographic user ID.

    primary
          Flag the current user id as the primary one, removes the
          primary user   id flag from all other user ids and sets the
          timestamp of all affected   self-signatures one second ahead.
          Note that setting a photo user ID   as primary makes it
          primary over other photo user IDs, and setting a   regular
          user ID as primary makes it primary over other regular user
          IDs.

    keyserver
          Set a preferred keyserver for the specified user ID(s). This
          allows   other users to know where you prefer they get your
          key from. See   `--keyserver-options honor-keyserver-url' for
          more on how this   works.  Setting a value of "none" removes
          an existing preferred   keyserver.

    notation
          Set a name=value notation for the specified user ID(s). See
          `--cert-notation' for more on how this works. Setting a value
          of   "none" removes all notations, setting a notation
          prefixed with a minus   sign (-) removes that notation, and
          setting a notation name (without the   =value) prefixed with
          a minus sign removes all notations with that name.

    pref
          List preferences from the selected user ID. This shows the
          actual   preferences, without including any implied
          preferences.

    showpref
          More verbose preferences listing for the selected user ID.
          This shows   the preferences in effect by including the
          implied preferences of 3DES   (cipher), SHA-1 (digest), and
          Uncompressed (compression) if they are   not already included
          in the preference list. In addition, the   preferred
          keyserver and signature notations (if any) are shown.

    setpref `string'
          Set the list of user ID preferences to `string' for all (or
          just   the selected) user IDs. Calling setpref with no
          arguments sets the   preference list to the default (either
          built-in or set via   `--default-preference-list'), and
          calling setpref with "none"   as the argument sets an empty
          preference list. Use `gpg   --version' to get a list of
          available algorithms. Note that while you   can change the
          preferences on an attribute user ID (aka "photo ID"),   GnuPG
          does not select keys via attribute user IDs so these
          preferences   will not be used by GnuPG.

          When setting preferences, you should list the algorithms in
          the order   which you'd like to see them used by someone else
          when encrypting a   message to your key.  If you don't
          include 3DES, it will be   automatically added at the end.
          Note that there are many factors that   go into choosing an
          algorithm (for example, your key may not be the   only
          recipient), and so the remote OpenPGP application being used
          to   send to you may or may not follow your exact chosen
          order for a given   message.  It will, however, only choose
          an algorithm that is present   on the preference list of
          every recipient key.  See also the   INTEROPERABILITY WITH
          OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below.

    addkey
          Add a subkey to this key.

    addcardkey
          Generate a subkey on a card and add it to this key.

    keytocard
          Transfer the selected secret subkey (or the primary key if no
          subkey   has been selected) to a smartcard. The secret key in
          the keyring will   be replaced by a stub if the key could be
          stored successfully on the   card and you use the save
          command later. Only certain key types may be   transferred to
          the card. A sub menu allows you to select on what card   to
          store the key. Note that it is not possible to get that key
          back   from the card - if the card gets broken your secret
          key will be lost   unless you have a backup somewhere.

    bkuptocard `file'
          Restore the given file to a card. This command may be used to
          restore a   backup key (as generated during card
          initialization) to a new card. In   almost all cases this
          will be the encryption key. You should use this   command
          only with the corresponding public key and make sure that the
           file given as argument is indeed the backup to restore. You
          should then   select 2 to restore as encryption key.  You
          will first be asked to enter   the passphrase of the backup
          key and then for the Admin PIN of the card.

    delkey
          Remove a subkey (secondart key). Note that it is not possible
          to retract   a subkey, once it has been send to the public
          (i.e. to a keyserver).  In   that case you better use
          `revkey'.

    revkey
          Revoke a subkey.

    expire
          Change the key or subkey expiration time. If a subkey is
          selected, the   expiration time of this subkey will be
          changed. With no selection, the   key expiration of the
          primary key is changed.

    trust
          Change the owner trust value for the key. This updates the
          trust-db   immediately and no save is required.

    disable
    enable
          Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key can not
          normally be   used for encryption.

    addrevoker
          Add a designated revoker to the key. This takes one optional
          argument:   "sensitive". If a designated revoker is marked as
          sensitive, it will   not be exported by default (see
          export-options).

    passwd
          Change the passphrase of the secret key.

    toggle
          Toggle between public and secret key listing.

    clean
          Compact (by removing all signatures except the selfsig) any
          user ID   that is no longer usable (e.g. revoked, or
          expired). Then, remove any   signatures that are not usable
          by the trust calculations.    Specifically, this removes any
          signature that does not validate, any   signature that is
          superseded by a later signature, revoked signatures,   and
          signatures issued by keys that are not present on the keyring.

    minimize
          Make the key as small as possible. This removes all
          signatures from   each user ID except for the most recent
          self-signature.

    cross-certify
          Add cross-certification signatures to signing subkeys that
          may not   currently have them. Cross-certification signatures
          protect against a   subtle attack against signing subkeys. See
           `--require-cross-certification'.  All new keys generated have
           this signature by default, so this option is only useful to
          bring   older keys up to date.

    save
          Save all changes to the key rings and quit.

    quit
          Quit the program without updating the   key rings.

     The listing shows you the key with its secondary keys and all user
     ids.  The primary user id is indicated by a dot, and selected keys
     or user ids are indicated by an asterisk.  The trust value is
     displayed with the primary key: the first is the assigned owner
     trust and the second is the calculated trust value. Letters are
     used for the values:

    -
          No ownertrust assigned / not yet calculated.

    e
          Trust   calculation has failed; probably due to an expired
          key.

    q
          Not enough information for calculation.

    n
          Never trust this key.

    m
          Marginally trusted.

    f
          Fully trusted.

    u
          Ultimately trusted.


`--sign-key `name''
     Signs a public key with your secret key. This is a shortcut
     version of the subcommand "sign" from `--edit'.

`--lsign-key `name''
     Signs a public key with your secret key but marks it as
     non-exportable. This is a shortcut version of the subcommand
     "lsign" from `--edit-key'.

1.2 Option Summary
==================

`gpg' features a bunch of options to control the exact behaviour and to
change the default configuration.

* Menu:

* GPG Configuration Options::   How to change the configuration.
* GPG Key related Options::     Key related options.
* GPG Input and Output::        Input and Output.
* OpenPGP Options::             OpenPGP protocol specific options.
* GPG Esoteric Options::        Doing things one usually don't want to do.

   Long options can be put in an options file (default
"~/.gnupg/gpg.conf"). Short option names will not work - for example,
"armor" is a valid option for the options file, while "a" is not. Do not
write the 2 dashes, but simply the name of the option and any required
arguments. Lines with a hash ('#') as the first non-white-space
character are ignored. Commands may be put in this file too, but that is
not generally useful as the command will execute automatically with
every execution of gpg.

   Please remember that option parsing stops as soon as a non-option is
encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing by using the special option
`--'.

1.2.1 How to change the configuration
-------------------------------------

These options are used to change the configuration and are usually found
in the option file.

`--default-key NAME'
     Use NAME as the default key to sign with. If this option is not
     used, the default key is the first key found in the secret keyring.
     Note that `-u' or `--local-user' overrides this option.

`--default-recipient NAME'
     Use NAME as default recipient if option `--recipient' is not used
     and don't ask if this is a valid one. NAME must be non-empty.

`--default-recipient-self'
     Use the default key as default recipient if option `--recipient'
     is not used and don't ask if this is a valid one. The default key
     is the first one from the secret keyring or the one set with
     `--default-key'.

`--no-default-recipient'
     Reset `--default-recipient' and `--default-recipient-self'.

`-v, --verbose'
     Give more information during processing. If used twice, the input
     data is listed in detail.

`--no-verbose'
     Reset verbose level to 0.

`-q, --quiet'
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

`--batch'
`--no-batch'
     Use batch mode.  Never ask, do not allow interactive commands.
     `--no-batch' disables this option.  Note that even with a filename
     given on the command line, gpg might still need to read from STDIN
     (in particular if gpg figures that the input is a detached
     signature and no data file has been specified).  Thus if you do
     not want to feed data via STDIN, you should connect STDIN to
     `/dev/null'.

`--no-tty'
     Make sure that the TTY (terminal) is never used for any output.
     This option is needed in some cases because GnuPG sometimes prints
     warnings to the TTY even if `--batch' is used.

`--yes'
     Assume "yes" on most questions.

`--no'
     Assume "no" on most questions.

`--list-options `parameters''
     This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used
     when listing keys and signatures (that is, `--list-keys',
     `--list-sigs', `--list-public-keys', `--list-secret-keys', and the
     `--edit-key' functions).  Options can be prepended with a `no-'
     (after the two dashes) to give the opposite meaning.  The options
     are:

    show-photos
          Causes `--list-keys', `--list-sigs',   `--list-public-keys',
          and `--list-secret-keys' to   display any photo IDs attached
          to the key.  Defaults to no. See also   `--photo-viewer'.
          Does not work with `--with-colons':   see `--attribute-fd'
          for the appropriate way to get photo data   for scripts and
          other frontends.

    show-policy-urls
          Show policy URLs in the `--list-sigs' or `--check-sigs'
          listings.  Defaults to no.

    show-notations
    show-std-notations
    show-user-notations
          Show all, IETF standard, or user-defined signature notations
          in the   `--list-sigs' or `--check-sigs' listings. Defaults
          to no.

    show-keyserver-urls
          Show any preferred keyserver URL in the `--list-sigs' or
          `--check-sigs' listings. Defaults to no.

    show-uid-validity
          Display the calculated validity of user IDs during key
          listings.    Defaults to no.

    show-unusable-uids
          Show revoked and expired user IDs in key listings. Defaults
          to no.

    show-unusable-subkeys
          Show revoked and expired subkeys in key listings. Defaults to
          no.

    show-keyring
          Display the keyring name at the head of key listings to show
          which   keyring a given key resides on. Defaults to no.

    show-sig-expire
          Show signature expiration dates (if any) during `--list-sigs'
          or   `--check-sigs' listings. Defaults to no.

    show-sig-subpackets
          Include signature subpackets in the key listing. This option
          can take an   optional argument list of the subpackets to
          list. If no argument is   passed, list all subpackets.
          Defaults to no. This option is only   meaningful when using
          `--with-colons' along with   `--list-sigs' or `--check-sigs'.


`--verify-options `parameters''
     This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used
     when verifying signatures. Options can be prepended with a `no-'
     to give the opposite meaning. The options are:

    show-photos
          Display any photo IDs present on the key that issued the
          signature.    Defaults to no. See also `--photo-viewer'.

    show-policy-urls
          Show policy URLs in the signature being verified. Defaults to
          no.

    show-notations
    show-std-notations
    show-user-notations
          Show all, IETF standard, or user-defined signature notations
          in the   signature being verified. Defaults to IETF standard.

    show-keyserver-urls
          Show any preferred keyserver URL in the signature being
          verified.    Defaults to no.

    show-uid-validity
          Display the calculated validity of the user IDs on the key
          that issued   the signature. Defaults to no.

    show-unusable-uids
          Show revoked and expired user IDs during signature
          verification.    Defaults to no.

    show-primary-uid-only
          Show only the primary user ID during signature verification.
          That is   all the AKA lines as well as photo Ids are not
          shown with the signature   verification status.

    pka-lookups
          Enable PKA lookups to verify sender addresses. Note that PKA
          is based   on DNS, and so enabling this option may disclose
          information on when   and what signatures are verified or to
          whom data is encrypted. This   is similar to the "web bug"
          described for the auto-key-retrieve   feature.

    pka-trust-increase
          Raise the trust in a signature to full if the signature
          passes PKA   validation. This option is only meaningful if
          pka-lookups is set.

`--enable-dsa2'
`--disable-dsa2'
     Enable hash truncation for all DSA keys even for old DSA Keys up to
     1024 bit.  This is also the default with `--openpgp'.  Note that
     older versions of GnuPG also required this flag to allow the
     generation of DSA larger than 1024 bit.

`--photo-viewer `string''
     This is the command line that should be run to view a photo ID.
     "%i" will be expanded to a filename containing the photo. "%I"
     does the same, except the file will not be deleted once the viewer
     exits.  Other flags are "%k" for the key ID, "%K" for the long key
     ID, "%f" for the key fingerprint, "%t" for the extension of the
     image type (e.g. "jpg"), "%T" for the MIME type of the image (e.g.
     "image/jpeg"), "%v" for the single-character calculated validity
     of the image being viewed (e.g. "f"), "%V" for the calculated
     validity as a string (e.g.  "full"), and "%%" for an actual
     percent sign. If neither %i or %I are present, then the photo will
     be supplied to the viewer on standard input.

     The default viewer is "xloadimage -fork -quiet -title 'KeyID 0x%k'
     STDIN". Note that if your image viewer program is not secure, then
     executing it from GnuPG does not make it secure.

`--exec-path `string''
     Sets a list of directories to search for photo viewers and
     keyserver helpers. If not provided, keyserver helpers use the
     compiled-in default directory, and photo viewers use the $PATH
     environment variable.  Note, that on W32 system this value is
     ignored when searching for keyserver helpers.

`--keyring `file''
     Add `file' to the current list of keyrings. If `file' begins with
     a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory. If
     the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the
     GnuPG home directory ("~/.gnupg" if `--homedir' or $GNUPGHOME is
     not used).

     Note that this adds a keyring to the current list. If the intent
     is to use the specified keyring alone, use `--keyring' along with
     `--no-default-keyring'.

`--secret-keyring `file''
     Same as `--keyring' but for the secret keyrings.

`--primary-keyring `file''
     Designate `file' as the primary public keyring. This means that
     newly imported keys (via `--import' or keyserver `--recv-from')
     will go to this keyring.

`--trustdb-name `file''
     Use `file' instead of the default trustdb. If `file' begins with a
     tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory. If
     the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the
     GnuPG home directory (`~/.gnupg' if `--homedir' or $GNUPGHOME is
     not used).

`--homedir DIR'
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR. If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to `~/.gnupg'.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable `GNUPGHOME'
     or (on W32 systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

`--pcsc-driver `file''
     Use `file' to access the smartcard reader. The current default is
     `libpcsclite.so.1' for GLIBC based systems,
     `/System/Library/Frameworks/PCSC.framework/PCSC' for MAC OS X,
     `winscard.dll' for Windows and `libpcsclite.so' for other systems.

`--disable-ccid'
     Disable the integrated support for CCID compliant readers. This
     allows to fall back to one of the other drivers even if the
     internal CCID driver can handle the reader. Note, that CCID
     support is only available if libusb was available at build time.

`--reader-port `number_or_string''
     This option may be used to specify the port of the card terminal. A
     value of 0 refers to the first serial device; add 32768 to access
     USB devices. The default is 32768 (first USB device). PC/SC or CCID
     readers might need a string here; run the program in verbose mode
     to get a list of available readers. The default is then the first
     reader found.

`--display-charset `name''
     Set the name of the native character set. This is used to convert
     some informational strings like user IDs to the proper UTF-8
     encoding.  Note that this has nothing to do with the character set
     of data to be encrypted or signed; GnuPG does not recode
     user-supplied data. If this option is not used, the default
     character set is determined from the current locale. A verbosity
     level of 3 shows the chosen set.  Valid values for `name' are:

    iso-8859-1
          This is the Latin 1 set.

    iso-8859-2
          The Latin 2 set.

    iso-8859-15
          This is currently an alias for   the Latin 1 set.

    koi8-r
          The usual Russian set (rfc1489).

    utf-8
          Bypass all translations and assume   that the OS uses native
          UTF-8 encoding.

`--utf8-strings'
`--no-utf8-strings'
     Assume that command line arguments are given as UTF8 strings. The
     default (`--no-utf8-strings') is to assume that arguments are
     encoded in the character set as specified by `--display-charset'.
     These options affect all following arguments. Both options may be
     used multiple times.

`--options `file''
     Read options from `file' and do not try to read them from the
     default options file in the homedir (see `--homedir'). This option
     is ignored if used in an options file.

`--no-options'
     Shortcut for `--options /dev/null'. This option is detected before
     an attempt to open an option file.  Using this option will also
     prevent the creation of a `~/.gnupg' homedir.

`-z `n''
`--compress-level `n''
`--bzip2-compress-level `n''
     Set compression level to `n' for the ZIP and ZLIB compression
     algorithms. The default is to use the default compression level of
     zlib (normally 6). `--bzip2-compress-level' sets the compression
     level for the BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting to 6 as
     well). This is a different option from `--compress-level' since
     BZIP2 uses a significant amount of memory for each additional
     compression level.  `-z' sets both. A value of 0 for `n' disables
     compression.

`--bzip2-decompress-lowmem'
     Use a different decompression method for BZIP2 compressed files.
     This alternate method uses a bit more than half the memory, but
     also runs at half the speed. This is useful under extreme low
     memory circumstances when the file was originally compressed at a
     high `--bzip2-compress-level'.

`--mangle-dos-filenames'
`--no-mangle-dos-filenames'
     Older version of Windows cannot handle filenames with more than one
     dot. `--mangle-dos-filenames' causes GnuPG to replace (rather than
     add to) the extension of an output filename to avoid this problem.
     This option is off by default and has no effect on non-Windows
     platforms.

`--ask-cert-level'
`--no-ask-cert-level'
     When making a key signature, prompt for a certification level. If
     this option is not specified, the certification level used is set
     via `--default-cert-level'. See `--default-cert-level' for
     information on the specific levels and how they are used.
     `--no-ask-cert-level' disables this option. This option defaults
     to no.

`--default-cert-level `n''
     The default to use for the check level when signing a key.

     0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you
     verified the key.

     1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to
     own it but you could not, or did not verify the key at all. This is
     useful for a "persona" verification, where you sign the key of a
     pseudonymous user.

     2 means you did casual verification of the key. For example, this
     could mean that you verified that the key fingerprint and checked
     the user ID on the key against a photo ID.

     3 means you did extensive verification of the key. For example,
     this could mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the
     owner of the key in person, and that you checked, by means of a
     hard to forge document with a photo ID (such as a passport) that
     the name of the key owner matches the name in the user ID on the
     key, and finally that you verified (by exchange of email) that the
     email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

     Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are just
     that: examples. In the end, it is up to you to decide just what
     "casual" and "extensive" mean to you.

     This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim).

`--min-cert-level'
     When building the trust database, treat any signatures with a
     certification level below this as invalid. Defaults to 2, which
     disregards level 1 signatures. Note that level 0 "no particular
     claim" signatures are always accepted.

`--trusted-key `long key ID''
     Assume that the specified key (which must be given as a full 8
     byte key ID) is as trustworthy as one of your own secret keys.
     This option is useful if you don't want to keep your secret keys
     (or one of them) online but still want to be able to check the
     validity of a given recipient's or signator's key.

`--trust-model `pgp|classic|direct|always|auto''
     Set what trust model GnuPG should follow. The models are:

    pgp
          This is the Web of Trust combined with trust signatures as
          used in PGP   5.x and later. This is the default trust model
          when creating a new   trust database.

    classic
          This is the standard Web of Trust as used in PGP 2.x and
          earlier.

    direct
          Key validity is set directly by the user and not calculated
          via the   Web of Trust.

    always
          Skip key validation and assume that used keys are always fully
           trusted. You generally won't use this unless you are using
          some   external validation scheme. This option also
          suppresses the   "[uncertain]" tag printed with signature
          checks when there is no   evidence that the user ID is bound
          to the key.

    auto
          Select the trust model depending on whatever the internal
          trust   database says. This is the default model if such a
          database already   exists.

`--auto-key-locate `parameters''
`--no-auto-key-locate'
     GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using
     this option. This happens when encrypting to an email address (in
     the "user@example.com" form), and there are no user@example.com
     keys on the local keyring.  This option takes any number of the
     following mechanisms, in the order they are to be tried:

    cert
          Locate a key using DNS CERT, as specified in rfc4398.

    pka
          Locate a key using DNS PKA.

    ldap
          Using DNS Service Discovery, check the domain in question for
          any LDAP   keyservers to use.  If this fails, attempt to
          locate the key using the   PGP Universal method of checking
          `ldap://keys.(thedomain)'.

    keyserver
          Locate a key using whatever keyserver is defined using the
          `--keyserver' option.

    keyserver-URL
          In addition, a keyserver URL as used in the `--keyserver'
          option   may be used here to query that particular keyserver.

    local
          Locate the key using the local keyrings.  This mechanism
          allows to   select the order a local key lookup is done.
          Thus using   `--auto-key-locate local' is identical to
          `--no-auto-key-locate'.

    nodefault
          This flag disables the standard local key lookup, done before
          any of the   mechanisms defined by the `--auto-key-locate'
          are tried.  The   position of this mechanism in the list does
          not matter.  It is not   required if `local' is also used.


`--keyid-format `short|0xshort|long|0xlong''
     Select how to display key IDs. "short" is the traditional
     8-character key ID. "long" is the more accurate (but less
     convenient) 16-character key ID. Add an "0x" to either to include
     an "0x" at the beginning of the key ID, as in 0x99242560.  Note
     that this option is ignored if the option -with-colons is used.

`--keyserver `name''
     Use `name' as your keyserver. This is the server that
     `--recv-keys', `--send-keys', and `--search-keys' will communicate
     with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on.
     The format of the `name' is a URI:
     `scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]' The scheme is the type of
     keyserver: "hkp" for the HTTP (or compatible) keyservers, "ldap"
     for the LDAP keyservers, or "mailto" for the Graff email
     keyserver. Note that your particular installation of GnuPG may
     have other keyserver types available as well. Keyserver schemes
     are case-insensitive. After the keyserver name, optional keyserver
     configuration options may be provided. These are the same as the
     global `--keyserver-options' from below, but apply only to this
     particular keyserver.

     Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is generally
     no need to send keys to more than one server. The keyserver
     `hkp://keys.gnupg.net' uses round robin DNS to give a different
     keyserver each time you use it.

`--keyserver-options `name=value1 ''
     This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for
     the keyserver. Options can be prefixed with a `no-' to give the
     opposite meaning. Valid import-options or export-options may be
     used here as well to apply to importing (`--recv-key') or exporting
     (`--send-key') a key from a keyserver. While not all options are
     available for all keyserver types, some common options are:

    include-revoked
          When searching for a key with `--search-keys', include keys
          that   are marked on the keyserver as revoked. Note that not
          all keyservers   differentiate between revoked and unrevoked
          keys, and for such   keyservers this option is meaningless.
          Note also that most keyservers do   not have cryptographic
          verification of key revocations, and so turning   this option
          off may result in skipping keys that are incorrectly marked
          as revoked.

    include-disabled
          When searching for a key with `--search-keys', include keys
          that   are marked on the keyserver as disabled. Note that
          this option is not   used with HKP keyservers.

    auto-key-retrieve
          This option enables the automatic retrieving of keys from a
          keyserver   when verifying signatures made by keys that are
          not on the local   keyring.

          Note that this option makes a "web bug" like behavior
          possible.    Keyserver operators can see which keys you
          request, so by sending you   a message signed by a brand new
          key (which you naturally will not have   on your local
          keyring), the operator can tell both your IP address and
          the time when you verified the signature.

    honor-keyserver-url
          When using `--refresh-keys', if the key in question has a
          preferred   keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver
          to refresh the key   from. In addition, if auto-key-retrieve
          is set, and the signature   being verified has a preferred
          keyserver URL, then use that preferred   keyserver to fetch
          the key from. Defaults to yes.

    honor-pka-record
          If auto-key-retrieve is set, and the signature being verified
          has a   PKA record, then use the PKA information to fetch the
          key. Defaults   to yes.

    include-subkeys
          When receiving a key, include subkeys as potential targets.
          Note that   this option is not used with HKP keyservers, as
          they do not support   retrieving keys by subkey id.

    use-temp-files
          On most Unix-like platforms, GnuPG communicates with the
          keyserver   helper program via pipes, which is the most
          efficient method. This   option forces GnuPG to use temporary
          files to communicate. On some   platforms (such as Win32 and
          RISC OS), this option is always enabled.

    keep-temp-files
          If using `use-temp-files', do not delete the temp files after
          using   them. This option is useful to learn the keyserver
          communication   protocol by reading the temporary files.

    verbose
          Tell the keyserver helper program to be more verbose. This
          option can   be repeated multiple times to increase the
          verbosity level.

    timeout
          Tell the keyserver helper program how long (in seconds) to
          try and   perform a keyserver action before giving up. Note
          that performing   multiple actions at the same time uses this
          timeout value per action.    For example, when retrieving
          multiple keys via `--recv-keys', the   timeout applies
          separately to each key retrieval, and not to the
          `--recv-keys' command as a whole. Defaults to 30 seconds.

    http-proxy=`value'
          Set the proxy to use for HTTP and HKP keyservers.  This
          overrides the   "http_proxy" environment variable, if any.

    max-cert-size
          When retrieving a key via DNS CERT, only accept keys up to
          this size.    Defaults to 16384 bytes.

    debug
          Turn on debug output in the keyserver helper program.  Note
          that the   details of debug output depends on which keyserver
          helper program is   being used, and in turn, on any libraries
          that the keyserver helper   program uses internally (libcurl,
          openldap, etc).

    check-cert
          Enable certificate checking if the keyserver presents one
          (for hkps or   ldaps).  Defaults to on.

    ca-cert-file
          Provide a certificate store to override the system default.
          Only   necessary if check-cert is enabled, and the keyserver
          is using a   certificate that is not present in a system
          default certificate list.

          Note that depending on the SSL library that the keyserver
          helper is   built with, this may actually be a directory or a
          file.

`--completes-needed `n''
     Number of completely trusted users to introduce a new key signer
     (defaults to 1).

`--marginals-needed `n''
     Number of marginally trusted users to introduce a new key signer
     (defaults to 3)

`--max-cert-depth `n''
     Maximum depth of a certification chain (default is 5).

`--simple-sk-checksum'
     Secret keys are integrity protected by using a SHA-1 checksum. This
     method is part of the upcoming enhanced OpenPGP specification but
     GnuPG already uses it as a countermeasure against certain attacks.
     Old applications don't understand this new format, so this option
     may be used to switch back to the old behaviour. Using this option
     bears a security risk. Note that using this option only takes
     effect when the secret key is encrypted - the simplest way to make
     this happen is to change the passphrase on the key (even changing
     it to the same value is acceptable).

`--no-sig-cache'
     Do not cache the verification status of key signatures.  Caching
     gives a much better performance in key listings. However, if you
     suspect that your public keyring is not save against write
     modifications, you can use this option to disable the caching. It
     probably does not make sense to disable it because all kind of
     damage can be done if someone else has write access to your public
     keyring.

`--no-sig-create-check'
     GnuPG normally verifies each signature right after creation to
     protect against bugs and hardware malfunctions which could leak
     out bits from the secret key. This extra verification needs some
     time (about 115% for DSA keys), and so this option can be used to
     disable it.  However, due to the fact that the signature creation
     needs manual interaction, this performance penalty does not matter
     in most settings.

`--auto-check-trustdb'
`--no-auto-check-trustdb'
     If GnuPG feels that its information about the Web of Trust has to
     be updated, it automatically runs the `--check-trustdb' command
     internally.  This may be a time consuming process.
     `--no-auto-check-trustdb' disables this option.

`--use-agent'
`--no-use-agent'
     Try to use the GnuPG-Agent.  With this option, GnuPG first tries to
     connect to the agent before it asks for a passphrase.
     `--no-use-agent' disables this option.

`--gpg-agent-info'
     Override the value of the environment variable `GPG_AGENT_INFO'.
     This is only used when `--use-agent' has been given.  Given that
     this option is not anymore used by `gpg2', it should be avoided if
     possible.

`--lock-once'
     Lock the databases the first time a lock is requested and do not
     release the lock until the process terminates.

`--lock-multiple'
     Release the locks every time a lock is no longer needed. Use this
     to override a previous `--lock-once' from a config file.

`--lock-never'
     Disable locking entirely. This option should be used only in very
     special environments, where it can be assured that only one process
     is accessing those files. A bootable floppy with a stand-alone
     encryption system will probably use this. Improper usage of this
     option may lead to data and key corruption.

`--exit-on-status-write-error'
     This option will cause write errors on the status FD to immediately
     terminate the process. That should in fact be the default but it
     never worked this way and thus we need an option to enable this,
     so that the change won't break applications which close their end
     of a status fd connected pipe too early. Using this option along
     with `--enable-progress-filter' may be used to cleanly cancel long
     running gpg operations.

`--limit-card-insert-tries `n''
     With `n' greater than 0 the number of prompts asking to insert a
     smartcard gets limited to N-1. Thus with a value of 1 gpg won't at
     all ask to insert a card if none has been inserted at startup. This
     option is useful in the configuration file in case an application
     does not know about the smartcard support and waits ad infinitum
     for an inserted card.

`--no-random-seed-file'
     GnuPG uses a file to store its internal random pool over
     invocations.  This makes random generation faster; however
     sometimes write operations are not desired. This option can be
     used to achieve that with the cost of slower random generation.

`--no-greeting'
     Suppress the initial copyright message.

`--no-secmem-warning'
     Suppress the warning about "using insecure memory".

`--no-permission-warning'
     Suppress the warning about unsafe file and home directory
     (`--homedir') permissions. Note that the permission checks that
     GnuPG performs are not intended to be authoritative, but rather
     they simply warn about certain common permission problems. Do not
     assume that the lack of a warning means that your system is secure.

     Note that the warning for unsafe `--homedir' permissions cannot be
     suppressed in the gpg.conf file, as this would allow an attacker to
     place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place, and use this file to
     suppress warnings about itself. The `--homedir' permissions
     warning may only be suppressed on the command line.

`--no-mdc-warning'
     Suppress the warning about missing MDC integrity protection.

`--require-secmem'
`--no-require-secmem'
     Refuse to run if GnuPG cannot get secure memory. Defaults to no
     (i.e. run, but give a warning).

`--require-cross-certification'
`--no-require-cross-certification'
     When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the
     cross certification "back signature" on the subkey is present and
     valid.  This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys that
     can sign.  Defaults to `--require-cross-certification' for `gpg'.

`--expert'
`--no-expert'
     Allow the user to do certain nonsensical or "silly" things like
     signing an expired or revoked key, or certain potentially
     incompatible things like generating unusual key types. This also
     disables certain warning messages about potentially incompatible
     actions. As the name implies, this option is for experts only. If
     you don't fully understand the implications of what it allows you
     to do, leave this off. `--no-expert' disables this option.

1.2.2 Key related options
-------------------------

`--recipient NAME'
`-r'
     Encrypt for user id NAME. If this option or `--hidden-recipient'
     is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user-id unless
     `--default-recipient' is given.

`--hidden-recipient NAME'
`-R'
     Encrypt for user ID NAME, but hide the key ID of this user's key.
     This option helps to hide the receiver of the message and is a
     limited countermeasure against traffic analysis. If this option or
     `--recipient' is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user ID unless
     `--default-recipient' is given.

`--encrypt-to `name''
     Same as `--recipient' but this one is intended for use in the
     options file and may be used with your own user-id as an
     "encrypt-to-self". These keys are only used when there are other
     recipients given either by use of `--recipient' or by the asked
     user id.  No trust checking is performed for these user ids and
     even disabled keys can be used.

`--hidden-encrypt-to `name''
     Same as `--hidden-recipient' but this one is intended for use in
     the options file and may be used with your own user-id as a hidden
     "encrypt-to-self". These keys are only used when there are other
     recipients given either by use of `--recipient' or by the asked
     user id.  No trust checking is performed for these user ids and
     even disabled keys can be used.

`--no-encrypt-to'
     Disable the use of all `--encrypt-to' and `--hidden-encrypt-to'
     keys.

`--group `name=value1 ''
     Sets up a named group, which is similar to aliases in email
     programs.  Any time the group name is a recipient (`-r' or
     `--recipient'), it will be expanded to the values specified.
     Multiple groups with the same name are automatically merged into a
     single group.

     The values are `key IDs' or fingerprints, but any key description
     is accepted. Note that a value with spaces in it will be treated as
     two different values. Note also there is only one level of
     expansion -- you cannot make an group that points to another
     group. When used from the command line, it may be necessary to
     quote the argument to this option to prevent the shell from
     treating it as multiple arguments.

`--ungroup `name''
     Remove a given entry from the `--group' list.

`--no-groups'
     Remove all entries from the `--group' list.

`--local-user NAME'
`-u'
     Use NAME as the key to sign with. Note that this option overrides
     `--default-key'.

`--try-all-secrets'
     Don't look at the key ID as stored in the message but try all
     secret keys in turn to find the right decryption key. This option
     forces the behaviour as used by anonymous recipients (created by
     using `--throw-keyids' or `--hidden-recipient') and might come
     handy in case where an encrypted message contains a bogus key ID.

`--skip-hidden-recipients'
`--no-skip-hidden-recipients'
     During decryption skip all anonymous recipients.  This option
     helps in the case that people use the hidden recipients feature to
     hide there own encrypt-to key from others.  If oneself has many
     secret keys this may lead to a major annoyance because all keys
     are tried in turn to decrypt soemthing which was not really
     intended for it.  The drawback of this option is that it is
     currently not possible to decrypt a message which includes real
     anonymous recipients.



File: gnupg1.info,  Node: GPG Input and Output,  Next: OpenPGP Options,  Prev: GPG Key related Options,  Up: GPG Options

1.2.3 Input and Output
----------------------

`--armor'
`-a'
     Create ASCII armored output.  The default is to create the binary
     OpenPGP format.

`--no-armor'
     Assume the input data is not in ASCII armored format.

`--output FILE'
`-o FILE'
     Write output to FILE.

`--max-output `n''
     This option sets a limit on the number of bytes that will be
     generated when processing a file. Since OpenPGP supports various
     levels of compression, it is possible that the plaintext of a
     given message may be significantly larger than the original
     OpenPGP message. While GnuPG works properly with such messages,
     there is often a desire to set a maximum file size that will be
     generated before processing is forced to stop by the OS limits.
     Defaults to 0, which means "no limit".

`--import-options `parameters''
     This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for
     importing keys. Options can be prepended with a `no-' to give the
     opposite meaning. The options are:

    import-local-sigs
          Allow importing key signatures marked as "local". This is not
           generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme is being
          used.    Defaults to no.

    repair-pks-subkey-bug
          During import, attempt to repair the damage caused by the PKS
          keyserver   bug (pre version 0.9.6) that mangles keys with
          multiple subkeys. Note   that this cannot completely repair
          the damaged key as some crucial data   is removed by the
          keyserver, but it does at least give you back one   subkey.
          Defaults to no for regular `--import' and to yes for
          keyserver `--recv-keys'.

    merge-only
          During import, allow key updates to existing keys, but do not
          allow   any new keys to be imported. Defaults to no.

    import-clean
          After import, compact (remove all signatures except the
          self-signature) any user IDs from the new key that are not
          usable.    Then, remove any signatures from the new key that
          are not usable.    This includes signatures that were issued
          by keys that are not present   on the keyring. This option is
          the same as running the `--edit-key'   command "clean" after
          import. Defaults to no.

    import-minimal
          Import the smallest key possible. This removes all signatures
          except   the most recent self-signature on each user ID. This
          option is the   same as running the `--edit-key' command
          "minimize" after import.    Defaults to no.

`--export-options `parameters''
     This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for
     exporting keys. Options can be prepended with a `no-' to give the
     opposite meaning. The options are:

    export-local-sigs
          Allow exporting key signatures marked as "local". This is not
           generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme is being
          used.    Defaults to no.

    export-attributes
          Include attribute user IDs (photo IDs) while exporting. This
          is   useful to export keys if they are going to be used by an
          OpenPGP   program that does not accept attribute user IDs.
          Defaults to yes.

    export-sensitive-revkeys
          Include designated revoker information that was marked as
          "sensitive". Defaults to no.

    export-reset-subkey-passwd
          When using the `--export-secret-subkeys' command, this option
          resets   the passphrases for all exported subkeys to empty.
          This is useful   when the exported subkey is to be used on an
          unattended machine where   a passphrase doesn't necessarily
          make sense. Defaults to no.

    export-clean
          Compact (remove all signatures from) user IDs on the key being
           exported if the user IDs are not usable. Also, do not export
          any   signatures that are not usable. This includes
          signatures that were   issued by keys that are not present on
          the keyring. This option is   the same as running the
          `--edit-key' command "clean" before export   except that the
          local copy of the key is not modified. Defaults to   no.

    export-minimal
          Export the smallest key possible. This removes all signatures
          except the   most recent self-signature on each user ID. This
          option is the same as   running the `--edit-key' command
          "minimize" before export except   that the local copy of the
          key is not modified. Defaults to no.

`--with-colons'
     Print key listings delimited by colons. Note that the output will
     be encoded in UTF-8 regardless of any `--display-charset' setting.
     This format is useful when GnuPG is called from scripts and other
     programs as it is easily machine parsed. The details of this
     format are documented in the file `doc/DETAILS', which is included
     in the GnuPG source distribution.

`--fixed-list-mode'
     Do not merge primary user ID and primary key in `--with-colon'
     listing mode and print all timestamps as seconds since 1970-01-01.

`--with-fingerprint'
     Same as the command `--fingerprint' but changes only the format of
     the output and may be used together with another command.

1.2.4 OpenPGP protocol specific options.
----------------------------------------

`-t, --textmode'
`--no-textmode'
     Treat input files as text and store them in the OpenPGP canonical
     text form with standard "CRLF" line endings. This also sets the
     necessary flags to inform the recipient that the encrypted or
     signed data is text and may need its line endings converted back
     to whatever the local system uses. This option is useful when
     communicating between two platforms that have different line
     ending conventions (UNIX-like to Mac, Mac to Windows, etc).
     `--no-textmode' disables this option, and is the default.

     If `-t' (but not `--textmode') is used together with armoring and
     signing, this enables clearsigned messages. This kludge is needed
     for command-line compatibility with command-line versions of PGP;
     normally you would use `--sign' or `--clearsign' to select the
     type of the signature.

`--force-v3-sigs'
`--no-force-v3-sigs'
     OpenPGP states that an implementation should generate v4 signatures
     but PGP versions 5 through 7 only recognize v4 signatures on key
     material. This option forces v3 signatures for signatures on data.
     Note that this option implies `--no-ask-sig-expire', and unsets
     `--sig-policy-url', `--sig-notation', and `--sig-keyserver-url',
     as these features cannot be used with v3 signatures.
     `--no-force-v3-sigs' disables this option.  Defaults to no.

`--force-v4-certs'
`--no-force-v4-certs'
     Always use v4 key signatures even on v3 keys. This option also
     changes the default hash algorithm for v3 RSA keys from MD5 to
     SHA-1.  `--no-force-v4-certs' disables this option.

`--force-mdc'
     Force the use of encryption with a modification detection code.
     This is always used with the newer ciphers (those with a blocksize
     greater than 64 bits), or if all of the recipient keys indicate
     MDC support in their feature flags.

`--disable-mdc'
     Disable the use of the modification detection code. Note that by
     using this option, the encrypted message becomes vulnerable to a
     message modification attack.

`--personal-cipher-preferences `string''
     Set the list of personal cipher preferences to `string'.  Use `gpg
     --version' to get a list of available algorithms, and use `none'
     to set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely
     override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as
     GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by all
     recipients.  The most highly ranked cipher in this list is also
     used for the `--symmetric' encryption command.

`--personal-digest-preferences `string''
     Set the list of personal digest preferences to `string'.  Use `gpg
     --version' to get a list of available algorithms, and use `none'
     to set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely
     override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as
     GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by all
     recipients.  The most highly ranked digest algorithm in this list
     is also used when signing without encryption (e.g. `--clearsign'
     or `--sign').

`--personal-compress-preferences `string''
     Set the list of personal compression preferences to `string'.  Use
     `gpg --version' to get a list of available algorithms, and use
     `none' to set no preference at all.  This allows the user to
     safely override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key
     preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable
     by all recipients.  The most highly ranked compression algorithm
     in this list is also used when there are no recipient keys to
     consider (e.g. `--symmetric').

`--s2k-cipher-algo `name''
     Use `name' as the cipher algorithm used to protect secret keys.
     The default cipher is CAST5. This cipher is also used for
     conventional encryption if `--personal-cipher-preferences' and
     `--cipher-algo' is not given.

`--s2k-digest-algo `name''
     Use `name' as the digest algorithm used to mangle the passphrases.
     The default algorithm is SHA-1.

`--s2k-mode `n''
     Selects how passphrases are mangled. If `n' is 0 a plain
     passphrase (which is not recommended) will be used, a 1 adds a
     salt to the passphrase and a 3 (the default) iterates the whole
     process a number of times (see -s2k-count).  Unless `--rfc1991' is
     used, this mode is also used for conventional encryption.

`--s2k-count `n''
     Specify how many times the passphrase mangling is repeated.  This
     value may range between 1024 and 65011712 inclusive.  The default
     is inquired from gpg-agent.  Note that not all values in the
     1024-65011712 range are legal and if an illegal value is selected,
     GnuPG will round up to the nearest legal value.  This option is
     only meaningful if `--s2k-mode' is 3.


1.2.5 Compliance options
------------------------

These options control what GnuPG is compliant to. Only one of these
options may be active at a time. Note that the default setting of this
is nearly always the correct one. See the INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER
OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below before using one of these options.

`--gnupg'
     Use standard GnuPG behavior. This is essentially OpenPGP behavior
     (see `--openpgp'), but with some additional workarounds for common
     compatibility problems in different versions of PGP. This is the
     default option, so it is not generally needed, but it may be
     useful to override a different compliance option in the gpg.conf
     file.

`--openpgp'
     Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict OpenPGP
     behavior. Use this option to reset all previous options like
     `--s2k-*', `--cipher-algo', `--digest-algo' and `--compress-algo'
     to OpenPGP compliant values. All PGP workarounds are disabled.

`--rfc4880'
     Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict RFC-4880
     behavior. Note that this is currently the same thing as
     `--openpgp'.

`--rfc2440'
     Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict RFC-2440
     behavior.

`--rfc1991'
     Try to be more RFC-1991 (PGP 2.x) compliant.

`--pgp2'
     Set up all options to be as PGP 2.x compliant as possible, and
     warn if an action is taken (e.g. encrypting to a non-RSA key) that
     will create a message that PGP 2.x will not be able to handle.
     Note that `PGP 2.x' here means `MIT PGP 2.6.2'. There are other
     versions of PGP 2.x available, but the MIT release is a good
     common baseline.

     This option implies `--rfc1991 --disable-mdc --no-force-v4-certs
     --escape-from-lines --force-v3-sigs --cipher-algo IDEA
     --digest-algo MD5 --compress-algo ZIP'. It also disables
     `--textmode' when encrypting.

`--pgp6'
     Set up all options to be as PGP 6 compliant as possible. This
     restricts you to the ciphers IDEA (if the IDEA plugin is
     installed), 3DES, and CAST5, the hashes MD5, SHA1 and RIPEMD160,
     and the compression algorithms none and ZIP. This also disables
     -throw-keyids, and making signatures with signing subkeys as PGP 6
     does not understand signatures made by signing subkeys.

     This option implies `--disable-mdc --escape-from-lines
     --force-v3-sigs'.

`--pgp7'
     Set up all options to be as PGP 7 compliant as possible. This is
     identical to `--pgp6' except that MDCs are not disabled, and the
     list of allowable ciphers is expanded to add AES128, AES192,
     AES256, and TWOFISH.

`--pgp8'
     Set up all options to be as PGP 8 compliant as possible. PGP 8 is
     a lot closer to the OpenPGP standard than previous versions of
     PGP, so all this does is disable `--throw-keyids' and set
     `--escape-from-lines'.  All algorithms are allowed except for the
     SHA224, SHA384, and SHA512 digests.

1.2.6 Doing things one usually doesn't want to do.
--------------------------------------------------

`-n'
`--dry-run'
     Don't make any changes (this is not completely implemented).

`--list-only'
     Changes the behaviour of some commands. This is like `--dry-run'
     but different in some cases. The semantic of this command may be
     extended in the future. Currently it only skips the actual
     decryption pass and therefore enables a fast listing of the
     encryption keys.

`-i'
`--interactive'
     Prompt before overwriting any files.

`--debug-level LEVEL'
     Select the debug level for investigating problems. LEVEL may be a
     numeric value or by a keyword:

    `none'
          No debugging at all.  A value of less than 1 may be used
          instead of   the keyword.

    `basic'
          Some basic debug messages.  A value between 1 and 2 may be
          used   instead of the keyword.

    `advanced'
          More verbose debug messages.  A value between 3 and 5 may be
          used   instead of the keyword.

    `expert'
          Even more detailed messages.  A value between 6 and 8 may be
          used   instead of the keyword.

    `guru'
          All of the debug messages you can get. A value greater than 8
          may be   used instead of the keyword.  The creation of hash
          tracing files is   only enabled if the keyword is used.

     How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not
     specified and may change with newer releases of this program. They
     are however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

`--debug FLAGS'
     Set debugging flags. All flags are or-ed and FLAGS may be given in
     C syntax (e.g. 0x0042).

`--debug-all'
     Set all useful debugging flags.

`--debug-ccid-driver'
     Enable debug output from the included CCID driver for smartcards.
     Note that this option is only available on some system.

`--faked-system-time EPOCH'
     This option is only useful for testing; it sets the system time
     back or forth to EPOCH which is the number of seconds elapsed
     since the year 1970.  Alternatively EPOCH may be given as a full
     ISO time string (e.g. "20070924T154812").

`--enable-progress-filter'
     Enable certain PROGRESS status outputs. This option allows
     frontends to display a progress indicator while gpg is processing
     larger files.  There is a slight performance overhead using it.

`--status-fd `n''
     Write special status strings to the file descriptor `n'.  See the
     file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.

`--status-file `file''
     Same as `--status-fd', except the status data is written to file
     `file'.

`--logger-fd `n''
     Write log output to file descriptor `n' and not to STDERR.

`--log-file `file''
`--logger-file `file''
     Same as `--logger-fd', except the logger data is written to file
     `file'.  Note that `--log-file' is only implemented for GnuPG-2.

`--attribute-fd `n''
     Write attribute subpackets to the file descriptor `n'. This is most
     useful for use with `--status-fd', since the status messages are
     needed to separate out the various subpackets from the stream
     delivered to the file descriptor.

`--attribute-file `file''
     Same as `--attribute-fd', except the attribute data is written to
     file `file'.

`--comment `string''
`--no-comments'
     Use `string' as a comment string in clear text signatures and ASCII
     armored messages or keys (see `--armor'). The default behavior is
     not to use a comment string. `--comment' may be repeated multiple
     times to get multiple comment strings. `--no-comments' removes all
     comments.  It is a good idea to keep the length of a single comment
     below 60 characters to avoid problems with mail programs wrapping
     such lines.  Note that comment lines, like all other header lines,
     are not protected by the signature.

`--emit-version'
`--no-emit-version'
     Force inclusion of the version string in ASCII armored output.
     `--no-emit-version' disables this option.

`--sig-notation `name=value''
`--cert-notation `name=value''
`-N, --set-notation `name=value''
     Put the name value pair into the signature as notation data.
     `name' must consist only of printable characters or spaces, and
     must contain a '@' character in the form keyname@domain.example.com
     (substituting the appropriate keyname and domain name, of course).
     This is to help prevent pollution of the IETF reserved notation
     namespace. The `--expert' flag overrides the '@' check. `value'
     may be any printable string; it will be encoded in UTF8, so you
     should check that your `--display-charset' is set correctly. If
     you prefix `name' with an exclamation mark (!), the notation data
     will be flagged as critical (rfc2440:5.2.3.15). `--sig-notation'
     sets a notation for data signatures. `--cert-notation' sets a
     notation for key signatures (certifications). `--set-notation'
     sets both.

     There are special codes that may be used in notation names. "%k"
     will be expanded into the key ID of the key being signed, "%K"
     into the long key ID of the key being signed, "%f" into the
     fingerprint of the key being signed, "%s" into the key ID of the
     key making the signature, "%S" into the long key ID of the key
     making the signature, "%g" into the fingerprint of the key making
     the signature (which might be a subkey), "%p" into the fingerprint
     of the primary key of the key making the signature, "%c" into the
     signature count from the OpenPGP smartcard, and "%%" results in a
     single "%". %k, %K, and %f are only meaningful when making a key
     signature (certification), and %c is only meaningful when using
     the OpenPGP smartcard.

`--sig-policy-url `string''
`--cert-policy-url `string''
`--set-policy-url `string''
     Use `string' as a Policy URL for signatures (rfc2440:5.2.3.19).  If
     you prefix it with an exclamation mark (!), the policy URL packet
     will be flagged as critical. `--sig-policy-url' sets a policy url
     for data signatures. `--cert-policy-url' sets a policy url for key
     signatures (certifications). `--set-policy-url' sets both.

     The same %-expandos used for notation data are available here as
     well.

`--sig-keyserver-url `string''
     Use `string' as a preferred keyserver URL for data signatures. If
     you prefix it with an exclamation mark (!), the keyserver URL
     packet will be flagged as critical.

     The same %-expandos used for notation data are available here as
     well.

`--set-filename `string''
     Use `string' as the filename which is stored inside messages.
     This overrides the default, which is to use the actual filename of
     the file being encrypted.

`--for-your-eyes-only'
`--no-for-your-eyes-only'
     Set the `for your eyes only' flag in the message. This causes
     GnuPG to refuse to save the file unless the `--output' option is
     given, and PGP to use a "secure viewer" with a claimed
     Tempest-resistant font to display the message. This option
     overrides `--set-filename'.  `--no-for-your-eyes-only' disables
     this option.

`--use-embedded-filename'
`--no-use-embedded-filename'
     Try to create a file with a name as embedded in the data. This can
     be a dangerous option as it allows to overwrite files. Defaults to
     no.

`--cipher-algo `name''
     Use `name' as cipher algorithm. Running the program with the
     command `--version' yields a list of supported algorithms. If this
     is not used the cipher algorithm is selected from the preferences
     stored with the key. In general, you do not want to use this
     option as it allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard.
     `--personal-cipher-preferences' is the safe way to accomplish the
     same thing.

`--digest-algo `name''
     Use `name' as the message digest algorithm. Running the program
     with the command `--version' yields a list of supported
     algorithms. In general, you do not want to use this option as it
     allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard.
     `--personal-digest-preferences' is the safe way to accomplish the
     same thing.

`--compress-algo `name''
     Use compression algorithm `name'. "zlib" is RFC-1950 ZLIB
     compression. "zip" is RFC-1951 ZIP compression which is used by
     PGP.  "bzip2" is a more modern compression scheme that can
     compress some things better than zip or zlib, but at the cost of
     more memory used during compression and decompression.
     "uncompressed" or "none" disables compression. If this option is
     not used, the default behavior is to examine the recipient key
     preferences to see which algorithms the recipient supports. If all
     else fails, ZIP is used for maximum compatibility.

     ZLIB may give better compression results than ZIP, as the
     compression window size is not limited to 8k. BZIP2 may give even
     better compression results than that, but will use a significantly
     larger amount of memory while compressing and decompressing. This
     may be significant in low memory situations. Note, however, that
     PGP (all versions) only supports ZIP compression. Using any
     algorithm other than ZIP or "none" will make the message
     unreadable with PGP. In general, you do not want to use this
     option as it allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard.
     `--personal-compress-preferences' is the safe way to accomplish
     the same thing.

`--cert-digest-algo `name''
     Use `name' as the message digest algorithm used when signing a
     key. Running the program with the command `--version' yields a
     list of supported algorithms. Be aware that if you choose an
     algorithm that GnuPG supports but other OpenPGP implementations do
     not, then some users will not be able to use the key signatures
     you make, or quite possibly your entire key.

`--disable-cipher-algo `name''
     Never allow the use of `name' as cipher algorithm.  The given name
     will not be checked so that a later loaded algorithm will still
     get disabled.

`--disable-pubkey-algo `name''
     Never allow the use of `name' as public key algorithm.  The given
     name will not be checked so that a later loaded algorithm will
     still get disabled.

`--throw-keyids'
`--no-throw-keyids'
     Do not put the recipient key IDs into encrypted messages. This
     helps to hide the receivers of the message and is a limited
     countermeasure against traffic analysis.(1)  On the receiving
     side, it may slow down the decryption process because all
     available secret keys must be tried.  `--no-throw-keyids' disables
     this option. This option is essentially the same as using
     `--hidden-recipient' for all recipients.

`--not-dash-escaped'
     This option changes the behavior of cleartext signatures so that
     they can be used for patch files. You should not send such an
     armored file via email because all spaces and line endings are
     hashed too. You can not use this option for data which has 5
     dashes at the beginning of a line, patch files don't have this. A
     special armor header line tells GnuPG about this cleartext
     signature option.

`--escape-from-lines'
`--no-escape-from-lines'
     Because some mailers change lines starting with "From " to ">From
     " it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
     cleartext signatures to prevent the mail system from breaking the
     signature. Note that all other PGP versions do it this way too.
     Enabled by default. `--no-escape-from-lines' disables this option.

`--passphrase-repeat `n''
     Specify how many times `gpg' will request a new passphrase be
     repeated.  This is useful for helping memorize a passphrase.
     Defaults to 1 repetition.

`--passphrase-fd `n''
     Read the passphrase from file descriptor `n'. Only the first line
     will be read from file descriptor `n'. If you use 0 for `n', the
     passphrase will be read from STDIN. This can only be used if only
     one passphrase is supplied.

`--passphrase-file `file''
     Read the passphrase from file `file'. Only the first line will be
     read from file `file'. This can only be used if only one
     passphrase is supplied. Obviously, a passphrase stored in a file is
     of questionable security if other users can read this file. Don't
     use this option if you can avoid it.

`--passphrase `string''
     Use `string' as the passphrase. This can only be used if only one
     passphrase is supplied. Obviously, this is of very questionable
     security on a multi-user system. Don't use this option if you can
     avoid it.

`--command-fd `n''
     This is a replacement for the deprecated shared-memory IPC mode.
     If this option is enabled, user input on questions is not expected
     from the TTY but from the given file descriptor. It should be used
     together with `--status-fd'. See the file doc/DETAILS in the source
     distribution for details on how to use it.

`--command-file `file''
     Same as `--command-fd', except the commands are read out of file
     `file'

`--allow-non-selfsigned-uid'
`--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid'
     Allow the import and use of keys with user IDs which are not
     self-signed. This is not recommended, as a non self-signed user ID
     is trivial to forge. `--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid' disables.

`--allow-freeform-uid'
     Disable all checks on the form of the user ID while generating a
     new one. This option should only be used in very special
     environments as it does not ensure the de-facto standard format of
     user IDs.

`--ignore-time-conflict'
     GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and
     signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes a signature
     seems to be older than the key due to clock problems. This option
     makes these checks just a warning. See also `--ignore-valid-from'
     for timestamp issues on subkeys.

`--ignore-valid-from'
     GnuPG normally does not select and use subkeys created in the
     future.  This option allows the use of such keys and thus exhibits
     the pre-1.0.7 behaviour. You should not use this option unless
     there is some clock problem. See also `--ignore-time-conflict' for
     timestamp issues with signatures.

`--ignore-crc-error'
     The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is protected by a CRC checksum
     against transmission errors. Occasionally the CRC gets mangled
     somewhere on the transmission channel but the actual content
     (which is protected by the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still okay.
     This option allows GnuPG to ignore CRC errors.

`--ignore-mdc-error'
     This option changes a MDC integrity protection failure into a
     warning.  This can be useful if a message is partially corrupt,
     but it is necessary to get as much data as possible out of the
     corrupt message.  However, be aware that a MDC protection failure
     may also mean that the message was tampered with intentionally by
     an attacker.

`--no-default-keyring'
     Do not add the default keyrings to the list of keyrings. Note that
     GnuPG will not operate without any keyrings, so if you use this
     option and do not provide alternate keyrings via `--keyring' or
     `--secret-keyring', then GnuPG will still use the default public or
     secret keyrings.

`--skip-verify'
     Skip the signature verification step. This may be used to make the
     decryption faster if the signature verification is not needed.

`--with-key-data'
     Print key listings delimited by colons (like `--with-colons') and
     print the public key data.

`--fast-list-mode'
     Changes the output of the list commands to work faster; this is
     achieved by leaving some parts empty. Some applications don't need
     the user ID and the trust information given in the listings. By
     using this options they can get a faster listing. The exact
     behaviour of this option may change in future versions.  If you
     are missing some information, don't use this option.

`--no-literal'
     This is not for normal use. Use the source to see for what it
     might be useful.

`--set-filesize'
     This is not for normal use. Use the source to see for what it
     might be useful.

`--show-session-key'
     Display the session key used for one message. See
     `--override-session-key' for the counterpart of this option.

     We think that Key Escrow is a Bad Thing; however the user should
     have the freedom to decide whether to go to prison or to reveal
     the content of one specific message without compromising all
     messages ever encrypted for one secret key. DON'T USE IT UNLESS
     YOU ARE REALLY FORCED TO DO SO.

`--override-session-key `string''
     Don't use the public key but the session key `string'. The format
     of this string is the same as the one printed by
     `--show-session-key'. This option is normally not used but comes
     handy in case someone forces you to reveal the content of an
     encrypted message; using this option you can do this without
     handing out the secret key.

`--ask-sig-expire'
`--no-ask-sig-expire'
     When making a data signature, prompt for an expiration time. If
     this option is not specified, the expiration time set via
     `--default-sig-expire' is used. `--no-ask-sig-expire' disables
     this option.

`--default-sig-expire'
     The default expiration time to use for signature expiration. Valid
     values are "0" for no expiration, a number followed by the letter d
     (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for years) (for
     example "2m" for two months, or "5y" for five years), or an
     absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to "0".

`--ask-cert-expire'
`--no-ask-cert-expire'
     When making a key signature, prompt for an expiration time. If this
     option is not specified, the expiration time set via
     `--default-cert-expire' is used. `--no-ask-cert-expire' disables
     this option.

`--default-cert-expire'
     The default expiration time to use for key signature expiration.
     Valid values are "0" for no expiration, a number followed by the
     letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for
     years) (for example "2m" for two months, or "5y" for five years),
     or an absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to "0".

`--allow-secret-key-import'
     This is an obsolete option and is not used anywhere.

`--allow-multiple-messages'

`--no-allow-multiple-messages'
     Allow processing of multiple OpenPGP messages contained in a
     single file or stream.  Some programs that call GPG are not
     prepared to deal with multiple messages being processed together,
     so this option defaults to no.  Note that versions of GPG prior to
     1.4.7 always allowed multiple messages.

     Warning: Do not use this option unless you need it as a temporary
     workaround!

`--enable-special-filenames'
     This options enables a mode in which filenames of the form `-&n',
     where n is a non-negative decimal number, refer to the file
     descriptor n and not to a file with that name.

`--no-expensive-trust-checks'
     Experimental use only.

`--preserve-permissions'
     Don't change the permissions of a secret keyring back to user
     read/write only. Use this option only if you really know what you
     are doing.

`--default-preference-list `string''
     Set the list of default preferences to `string'. This preference
     list is used for new keys and becomes the default for "setpref" in
     the edit menu.

`--default-keyserver-url `name''
     Set the default keyserver URL to `name'. This keyserver will be
     used as the keyserver URL when writing a new self-signature on a
     key, which includes key generation and changing preferences.

`--list-config'
     Display various internal configuration parameters of GnuPG. This
     option is intended for external programs that call GnuPG to
     perform tasks, and is thus not generally useful. See the file
     `doc/DETAILS' in the source distribution for the details of which
     configuration items may be listed. `--list-config' is only usable
     with `--with-colons' set.

`--gpgconf-list'
     This command is similar to `--list-config' but in general only
     internally used by the `gpgconf' tool.

`--gpgconf-test'
     This is more or less dummy action.  However it parses the
     configuration file and returns with failure if the configuration
     file would prevent `gpg' from startup.  Thus it may be used to run
     a syntax check on the configuration file.


1.2.7 Deprecated options
------------------------

`--load-extension `name''
     Load an extension module. If `name' does not contain a slash it is
     searched for in the directory configured when GnuPG was built
     (generally "/usr/local/lib/gnupg"). Extensions are not generally
     useful anymore, and the use of this option is deprecated.

`--show-photos'
`--no-show-photos'
     Causes `--list-keys', `--list-sigs', `--list-public-keys',
     `--list-secret-keys', and verifying a signature to also display
     the photo ID attached to the key, if any. See also
     `--photo-viewer'. These options are deprecated. Use
     `--list-options [no-]show-photos' and/or `--verify-options
     [no-]show-photos' instead.

`--show-keyring'
     Display the keyring name at the head of key listings to show which
     keyring a given key resides on. This option is deprecated: use
     `--list-options [no-]show-keyring' instead.

`--ctapi-driver `file''
     Use `file' to access the smartcard reader. The current default is
     `libtowitoko.so'. Note that the use of this interface is
     deprecated; it may be removed in future releases.

`--always-trust'
     Identical to `--trust-model always'. This option is deprecated.

`--show-notation'
`--no-show-notation'
     Show signature notations in the `--list-sigs' or `--check-sigs'
     listings as well as when verifying a signature with a notation in
     it. These options are deprecated. Use `--list-options
     [no-]show-notation' and/or `--verify-options [no-]show-notation'
     instead.

`--show-policy-url'
`--no-show-policy-url'
     Show policy URLs in the `--list-sigs' or `--check-sigs' listings
     as well as when verifying a signature with a policy URL in it.
     These options are deprecated. Use `--list-options
     [no-]show-policy-url' and/or `--verify-options
     [no-]show-policy-url' instead.

1.3 Configuration files
=======================

There are a few configuration files to control certain aspects of
`gpg''s operation. Unless noted, they are expected in the current home
directory (*note option --homedir::).

`gpg.conf'
     This is the standard configuration file read by `gpg' on
     startup.  It may contain any valid long option; the leading two
     dashes   may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.
     This default   name may be changed on the command line (*note
     option --options::).    You should backup this file.


   Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put predefined
files into the directory `/etc/skel/.gnupg/' so that newly created users
start up with a working configuration.

   For internal purposes `gpg' creates and maintains a few other files;
They all live in in the current home directory (*note option
--homedir::).  Only the `gpg' may modify these files.

`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg'
     The secret keyring.  You should backup this file.

`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg.lock'
     The lock file for the secret keyring.

`~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg'
     The public keyring.  You should backup this file.

`~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.lock'
     The lock file for the public keyring.

`~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg'
     The trust database.  There is no need to backup this file; it is
     better   to backup the ownertrust values (*note option
     --export-ownertrust::).

`~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg.lock'
     The lock file for the trust database.

`~/.gnupg/random_seed'
     A file used to preserve the state of the internal random pool.

`/usr[/local]/share/gnupg/options.skel'
     The skeleton options file.

`/usr[/local]/lib/gnupg/'
     Default location for extensions.


   Operation is further controlled by a few environment variables:

HOME
     Used to locate the default home directory.

GNUPGHOME
     If set directory used instead of "~/.gnupg".

GPG_AGENT_INFO
     Used to locate the gpg-agent.      This is only honored when
     `--use-agent' is set.      The value consists of 3 colon delimited
     fields: The first is the path   to the Unix Domain Socket, the
     second the PID of the gpg-agent and the   protocol version which
     should be set to 1. When starting the gpg-agent   as described in
     its documentation, this variable is set to the correct   value.
     The option `--gpg-agent-info' can be used to override it.

PINENTRY_USER_DATA
     This value is passed via gpg-agent to pinentry.  It is useful to
     convey   extra information to a custom pinentry.

COLUMNS
LINES
     Used to size some displays to the full size of the screen.

LANGUAGE
     Apart from its use by GNU, it is used in the W32 version to
     override the   language selection done through the Registry.  If
     used and set to a   valid and available language name (LANGID),
     the file with the   translation is loaded from

     `GPGDIR/gnupg.nls/LANGID.mo'.  Here GPGDIR is the   directory out
     of which the gpg binary has been loaded.  If it can't be   loaded
     the Registry is tried and as last resort the native Windows
     locale system is used.

1.4 Examples
============

gpg -se -r `Bob' `file'
     sign and encrypt for user Bob

gpg -clearsign `file'
     make a clear text signature

gpg -sb `file'
     make a detached signature

gpg -u 0x12345678 -sb `file'
     make a detached signature with the key 0x12345678

gpg -list-keys `user_ID'
     show keys

gpg -fingerprint `user_ID'
     show fingerprint

gpg -verify `pgpfile'
gpg -verify `sigfile'
     Verify the signature of the file but do not output the data. The
     second form is used for detached signatures, where `sigfile' is
     the detached signature (either ASCII armored or binary) and are
     the signed data; if this is not given, the name of the file
     holding the signed data is constructed by cutting off the
     extension (".asc" or ".sig") of `sigfile' or by asking the user
     for the filename.

RETURN VALUE
************

The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least a signature
was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.

WARNINGS
********

Use a *good* password for your user account and a *good* passphrase to
protect your secret key. This passphrase is the weakest part of the
whole system. Programs to do dictionary attacks on your secret keyring
are very easy to write and so you should protect your "~/.gnupg/"
directory very well.

   Keep in mind that, if this program is used over a network (telnet),
it is *very* easy to spy out your passphrase!

   If you are going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the
program knows about it; either give both filenames on the command line
or use `-' to specify STDIN.

INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS
********************************************

GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP
standard. In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional parts of
the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2
compression algorithms. It is important to be aware that not all
OpenPGP programs implement these optional algorithms and that by
forcing their use via the `--cipher-algo', `--digest-algo',
`--cert-digest-algo', or `--compress-algo' options in GnuPG, it is
possible to create a perfectly valid OpenPGP message, but one that
cannot be read by the intended recipient.

   There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs available, and
each supports a slightly different subset of these optional algorithms.
For example, until recently, no (unhacked) version of PGP supported the
BLOWFISH cipher algorithm. A message using BLOWFISH simply could not be
read by a PGP user. By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP
preferences system that will always do the right thing and create
messages that are usable by all recipients, regardless of which OpenPGP
program they use. Only override this safe default if you really know
what you are doing.

   If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if the
preferences on a given key are invalid for some reason, you are far
better off using the `--pgp6', `--pgp7', or `--pgp8' options. These
options are safe as they do not force any particular algorithms in
violation of OpenPGP, but rather reduce the available algorithms to a
"PGP-safe" list.

BUGS
****

On older systems this program should be installed as setuid(root). This
is necessary to lock memory pages. Locking memory pages prevents the
operating system from writing memory pages (which may contain
passphrases or other sensitive material) to disk. If you get no warning
message about insecure memory your operating system supports locking
without being root. The program drops root privileges as soon as locked
memory is allocated.

   Note also that some systems (especially laptops) have the ability to
"suspend to disk" (also known as "safe sleep" or "hibernate").  This
writes all memory to disk before going into a low power or even powered
off mode.  Unless measures are taken in the operating system to protect
the saved memory, passphrases or other sensitive material may be
recoverable from it later.

   Before you report a bug you should first search the mailing list
archives for similar problems and second check whether such a bug has
already been reported to our bug tracker at http://bugs.gnupg.org .


File: gnupg1.info,  Node: Unattended Usage of GPG,  Prev: GPG Examples,  Up: Invoking GPG

1.5 Unattended Usage
====================

`gpg' is often used as a backend engine by other software.  To help
with this a machine interface has been defined to have an unambiguous
way to do this.  The options `--status-fd' and `--batch' are almost
always required for this.

* Menu:

* Unattended GPG key generation::  Unattended key generation


File: gnupg1.info,  Node: Unattended GPG key generation,  Up: Unattended Usage of GPG

1.6 Unattended key generation
=============================

The command `--gen-key' may be used along with the option `--batch' for
unattended key generation.  The parameters are either read from stdin
or given as a file on the command line.  The format of the parameter
file is as follows:

   * Text only, line length is limited to about 1000 characters.

   * UTF-8 encoding must be used to specify non-ASCII characters.

   * Empty lines are ignored.

   * Leading and trailing while space is ignored.

   * A hash sign as the first non white space character indicates   a
     comment line.

   * Control statements are indicated by a leading percent sign, the
     arguments are separated by white space from the keyword.

   * Parameters are specified by a keyword, followed by a colon.
     Arguments   are separated by white space.

   *   The first parameter must be `Key-Type'; control statements may be
      placed anywhere.

   *   The order of the parameters does not matter except for `Key-Type'
      which must be the first parameter.  The parameters are only used
     for   the generated keyblock (primary and subkeys); parameters
     from previous   sets are not used.  Some syntactically checks may
     be performed.

   *   Key generation takes place when either the end of the parameter
     file   is reached, the next `Key-Type' parameter is encountered or
     at the   control statement `%commit' is encountered.

Control statements:

%echo TEXT
     Print TEXT as diagnostic.

%dry-run
     Suppress actual key generation (useful for syntax checking).

%commit
     Perform the key generation.  Note that an implicit commit is done
     at the next Key-Type parameter.

%pubring FILENAME
%secring FILENAME
     Do not write the key to the default or commandline given keyring
     but to FILENAME.  This must be given before the first commit to
     take place, duplicate specification of the same filename is
     ignored, the last filename before a commit is used.  The filename
     is used until a new filename is used (at commit points) and all
     keys are written to that file. If a new filename is given, this
     file is created (and overwrites an existing one).  For GnuPG
     versions prior to 2.1, both control statements must be given. For
     GnuPG 2.1 and later `%secring' is a no-op.

%ask-passphrase
%no-ask-passphrase
     Enable (or disable) a mode where the command `passphrase' is
     ignored and instead the usual passphrase dialog is used.  This does
     not make sense for batch key generation; however the unattended key
     generation feature is also used by GUIs and this feature
     relinquishes the GUI from implementing its own passphrase entry
     code.  These are global control statements and affect all future
     key genrations.

%no-protection
     Since GnuPG version 2.1 it is not anymore possible to specify a
     passphrase for unattended key generation.  The passphrase command
     is simply ignored and `%ask-passpharse' is thus implicitly enabled.
     Using this option allows the creation of keys without any
     passphrase protection.  This option is mainly intended for
     regression tests.

%transient-key
     If given the keys are created using a faster and a somewhat less
     secure random number generator.  This option may be used for keys
     which are only used for a short time and do not require full
     cryptographic strength.  It takes only effect if used together with
     the control statement `%no-protection'.


General Parameters:

Key-Type: ALGO
     Starts a new parameter block by giving the type of the primary
     key. The algorithm must be capable of signing.  This is a required
     parameter.  ALGO may either be an OpenPGP algorithm number or a
     string with the algorithm name.  The special value `default' may
     be used for ALGO to create the default key type; in this case a
     `Key-Usage' shall not be given and `default' also be used for
     `Subkey-Type'.

Key-Length: NBITS
     The requested length of the generated key in bits.  The default is
     returned by running the command `gpg2 --gpgconf-list'.

Key-Grip: HEXSTRING
     This is optional and used to generate a CSR or certificate for an
     already existing key.  Key-Length will be ignored when given.

Key-Usage: USAGE-LIST
     Space or comma delimited list of key usages.  Allowed values are
     `encrypt', `sign', and `auth'.  This is used to generate the key
     flags.  Please make sure that the algorithm is capable of this
     usage.  Note that OpenPGP requires that all primary keys are
     capable of certification, so no matter what usage is given here,
     the `cert' flag will be on.  If no `Key-Usage' is specified and
     the `Key-Type' is not `default', all allowed usages for that
     particular algorithm are used; if it is not given but `default' is
     used the usage will be `sign'.

Subkey-Type: ALGO
     This generates a secondary key (subkey).  Currently only one subkey
     can be handled.  See also `Key-Type' above.

Subkey-Length: NBITS
     Length of the secondary key (subkey) in bits.  The default is
     returned by running the command `gpg2 --gpgconf-list'".

Subkey-Usage: USAGE-LIST
     Key usage lists for a subkey; similar to `Key-Usage'.

Passphrase: STRING
     If you want to specify a passphrase for the secret key, enter it
     here.	Default is not to use any passphrase.

Name-Real: NAME
Name-Comment: COMMENT
Name-Email: EMAIL
     The three parts of a user name.  Remember to use UTF-8 encoding
     here.  If you don't give any of them, no user ID is created.

Expire-Date: ISO-DATE|(NUMBER[d|w|m|y])
     Set the expiration date for the key (and the subkey).  It may
     either be entered in ISO date format (2000-08-15) or as number of
     days, weeks, month or years.  The special notation "seconds=N" is
     also allowed to directly give an Epoch value. Without a letter
     days are assumed.  Note that there is no check done on the
     overflow of the type used by OpenPGP for timestamps.  Thus you
     better make sure that the given value make sense.  Although
     OpenPGP works with time intervals, GnuPG uses an absolute value
     internally and thus the last year we can represent is 2105.

Ceation-Date: ISO-DATE
     Set the creation date of the key as stored in the key information
     and which is also part of the fingerprint calculation.  Either a
     date like "1986-04-26" or a full timestamp like "19860426T042640"
     may be used.  The time is considered to be UTC.  If it is not
     given the current time is used.

Preferences: STRING
     Set the cipher, hash, and compression preference values for this
     key.  This expects the same type of string as the sub-command
     `setpref' in the `--edit-key' menu.

Revoker: ALGO:FPR [sensitive]
     Add a designated revoker to the generated key.  Algo is the public
     key algorithm of the designated revoker (i.e. RSA=1, DSA=17, etc.)
     FPR is the fingerprint of the designated revoker.  The optional
     `sensitive' flag marks the designated revoker as sensitive
     information.  Only v4 keys may be designated revokers.

Keyserver: STRING
     This is an optional parameter that specifies the preferred
     keyserver URL for the key.

Handle: STRING
     This is an optional parameter only used with the status lines
     KEY_CREATED and KEY_NOT_CREATED.  STRING may be up to 100
     characters and should not contain spaces.  It is useful for batch
     key generation to associate a key parameter block with a status
     line.


Here is an example on how to create a key:
     $ cat >foo <<EOF
          %echo Generating a basic OpenPGP key
          Key-Type: DSA
          Key-Length: 1024
          Subkey-Type: ELG-E
          Subkey-Length: 1024
          Name-Real: Joe Tester
          Name-Comment: with stupid passphrase
          Name-Email: joe@foo.bar
          Expire-Date: 0
          Passphrase: abc
          %pubring foo.pub
          %secring foo.sec
          # Do a commit here, so that we can later print "done" :-)
          %commit
          %echo done
     EOF
     $ gpg2 --batch --gen-key foo
      [...]
     $ gpg2 --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring ./foo.sec \
            --keyring ./foo.pub --list-secret-keys
     /home/wk/work/gnupg-stable/scratch/foo.sec
     ------------------------------------------
     sec  1024D/915A878D 2000-03-09 Joe Tester (with stupid passphrase) <joe@foo.bar>
     ssb  1024g/8F70E2C0 2000-03-09

If you want to create a key with the default algorithms you would use
these parameters:
          %echo Generating a default key
          Key-Type: default
          Subkey-Type: default
          Name-Real: Joe Tester
          Name-Comment: with stupid passphrase
          Name-Email: joe@foo.bar
          Expire-Date: 0
          Passphrase: abc
          %pubring foo.pub
          %secring foo.sec
          # Do a commit here, so that we can later print "done" :-)
          %commit
          %echo done

2 How to Specify a User Id
**************************

There are different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG.  Some of them
are only valid for `gpg' others are only good for `gpgsm'.  Here is the
entire list of ways to specify a key:

   * By key Id.  This format is deduced from the length of the string
     and its content or `0x' prefix. The key Id of an X.509 certificate
     are the low 64 bits of its SHA-1 fingerprint.  The use of key Ids
     is just a shortcut, for all automated processing the fingerprint
     should be used.

     When using `gpg' an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force
     using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and
     calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

     The last four lines of the example give the key ID in their long
     form as internally used by the OpenPGP protocol. You can see the
     long key ID using the option `--with-colons'.

          234567C4
          0F34E556E
          01347A56A
          0xAB123456

          234AABBCC34567C4
          0F323456784E56EAB
          01AB3FED1347A5612
          0x234AABBCC34567C4

   * By fingerprint.  This format is deduced from the length of the
     string and its content or the `0x' prefix.  Note, that only the 20
     byte version fingerprint is available with `gpgsm' (i.e. the SHA-1
     hash of the certificate).

     When using `gpg' an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force
     using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and
     calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

     The best way to specify a key Id is by using the fingerprint.  This
     avoids any ambiguities in case that there are duplicated key IDs.

          1234343434343434C434343434343434
          123434343434343C3434343434343734349A3434
          0E12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434
          0xE12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434

     `gpgsm' also accepts colons between each pair of hexadecimal
     digits because this is the de-facto standard on how to present
     X.509 fingerprints.  `gpg' also allows the use of the space
     separated SHA-1 fingerprint as printed by the key listing commands.

   * By exact match on OpenPGP user ID.  This is denoted by a leading
     equal sign. It does not make sense for X.509 certificates.

          =Heinrich Heine <heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de>

   * By exact match on an email address.  This is indicated by
     enclosing the email address in the usual way with left and right
     angles.

          <heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de>

   * By word match.  All words must match exactly (not case sensitive)
     but can appear in any order in the user ID or a subjects name.
     Words are any sequences of letters, digits, the underscore and all
     characters with bit 7 set.

          +Heinrich Heine duesseldorf

   * By exact match on the subject's DN.  This is indicated by a
     leading slash, directly followed by the RFC-2253 encoded DN of the
     subject.  Note that you can't use the string printed by "gpgsm
     -list-keys" because that one as been reordered and modified for
     better readability; use -with-colons to print the raw (but standard
     escaped) RFC-2253 string

          /CN=Heinrich Heine,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR

   * By exact match on the issuer's DN.  This is indicated by a leading
     hash mark, directly followed by a slash and then directly followed
     by the rfc2253 encoded DN of the issuer.  This should return the
     Root cert of the issuer.  See note above.

          #/CN=Root Cert,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR

   * By exact match on serial number and issuer's DN.  This is
     indicated by a hash mark, followed by the hexadecimal
     representation of the serial number, then followed by a slash and
     the RFC-2253 encoded DN of the issuer. See note above.

          #4F03/CN=Root Cert,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR

   * By keygrip This is indicated by an ampersand followed by the 40
     hex digits of a keygrip.  `gpgsm' prints the keygrip when using
     the command `--dump-cert'.  It does not yet work for OpenPGP keys.

          &D75F22C3F86E355877348498CDC92BD21010A480

   * By substring match.  This is the default mode but applications may
     want to explicitly indicate this by putting the asterisk in front.
     Match is not case sensitive.

   Please note that we have reused the hash mark identifier which was
used in old GnuPG versions to indicate the so called local-id.  It is
not anymore used and there should be no conflict when used with X.509
stuff.

   Using the RFC-2253 format of DNs has the drawback that it is not
possible to map them back to the original encoding, however we don't
have to do this because our key database stores this encoding as meta
data.

GNU General Public License
**************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program-to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains
in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of
users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
     on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may
     convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any
     non-source form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work
     with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface
     for which an implementation is available to the public in source
     code form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including
     scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include
     the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
     associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
     shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work
     is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,
     given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License
     acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
     provided by copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for
     you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
     provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
     conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
     Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so
     exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on
     terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
     copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention
     to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
          as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of
          the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access
          to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated
          by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
          the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long
          as needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.


     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product
     is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or
     installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it
     has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied
     when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
     operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License
     with terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be
          marked in reasonable ways as different from the original
          version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
     conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work
     material governed by the terms of that license document, provided
     that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or
     conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under
     the third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new
     licenses for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
     possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
     predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
     with reasonable efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for
     exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not
     initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
     lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making,
     using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
     portion of it.

 11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its
     contributor version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To
     "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an
     agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under
     which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of
     your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third
     party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered
     work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection
     with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made
     from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
     specific products or compilations that contain the covered work,
     unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license
     was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
     simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
     pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it
     at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to
     collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you
     convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those
     terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying
     the Program.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
     concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
     version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
     FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

     To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found.
          ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
          Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

          This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
          it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
          the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
          your option) any later version.

          This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
          WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
          MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
          General Public License for more details.

          You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
          along with this program.  If not, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

     If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

          PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
          This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
          This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

     The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

     The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read `http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html'.
